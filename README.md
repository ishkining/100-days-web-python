## Diary

### 1-4 days - Flask - 23.07 16:14

It was quite easy, but I wanna mention that __init.py__ took me off guard, so I hope this course will be tough and I will learn a lot of stuff. And I'm glad that we started with venv already, fucking let'go!

### 4-8 days - HTML - 23.07 17:21

It was too, but I try to focus and I wanna give appreciation for those who carry and move over of their ego. I dislike front-end a lot, but it is only cause I actually have hard times coding html/css. So I take this seriously and I try to make it a bit better! Thanks:)

### 9-12 days - APISTAR - 23.07 18:48

### 13-16 days - CSS - 24.07 18:57
