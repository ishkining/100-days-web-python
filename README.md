## Diary

### 1-4 days - Flask - 23.07 16:14

It was quite easy, but I wanna mention that __init.py__ took me off guard, so I hope this course will be tough and I will learn a lot of stuff. And I'm glad that we started with venv already, fucking let'go!

### 4-8 days - HTML - 23.07 17:21

It was too, but I try to focus and I wanna give appreciation for those who carry and move over of their ego. I dislike front-end a lot, but it is only cause I actually have hard times coding html/css. So I take this seriously and I try to make it a bit better! Thanks:)

### 9-12 days - APISTAR - 23.07 18:48

Ooooh, it was much hotter than I expected. I learned a bit but it feels like I learned a lot. Command _breakpoint_ was astonishing. Sorry but I should learn more, and test were quite fun to play.

### 13-16 days - CSS - 24.07 18:57

Hehe, I have bad days recently, but I wanna go through all these stuff. It is actually funny to learn a bit stuff. They are also giving a lot of information about useful web resources where i can explore much more my potential.

### 17-20 days - Flask and API - 24.07 20:57

Unfortunately, I know all these stuff before, so it was just refreshing my knowledge. Only I get it new with __pprint__ library, that was cool.
   
### 21-24 days - Async and Quart - 24.07 22:50

That was actually really great. I suppose it was quite interesting cause I do not have big experience with asyncio. And I have learned a bit about Quart.

### 25-28 days - JS - 25.07 20:03

Oooooh, I have just watched a lot of stuff that I knew and so I feel like I have wasted time, but I really believe that I should do all these for tricking my mind to be precise.
